  <h3>About Brain Jar</h3>
  <p>Brain Jar began as an art project and gateway into the world of game development for a couple of college students.
    Founded by artists Josh Petty and Russell White, Brain Jar has now created
    several video games and serves as a platform for the making of tutorials and
    other educational materials. We love making games and learning about making games.




  <p>Our game,<a href="{% url 'cosmic-trash' %}">Cosmic Trash</a>, was featured
  at the Indie Games Festival in 2017.
